## Fault Configuration - Embrace the Unexpected

To start our wild journey, let's dive into fault configuration techniques that will make your script bulletproof. The script applies the `-Eeuo pipefail` option, which ensures that any error or unexpected behavior will be caught without mercy. It's like having a superhero shield that protects your code from lurking bugs and prevents small issues from snowballing into disasters. 

Let's take a closer look at the code snippet that sets this fault configuration:

```bash
set -Eeuo pipefail
```
In this example, each element of the option has its own superpower:

* The **-E ** option activates the ERR trap, which catches any command that returns a non-zero exit code and triggers the cleanup function we'll discuss later.
* The **-e ** option immediately exits the script if any command within it fails, preventing any further execution. 
* The **-u ** option treats unset variables as errors, ensuring that your script won't run blindly with undefined values. 
* The pipefail option ensures that the script fails if any command in a pipeline fails, even if other commands in the pipeline succeed. It prevents silent errors from slipping through the cracks, keeping your code robust.

## Magic Variables - The Script's Little Helpers

Now, let's unravel the magic behind some special variables that make our script's life easier. These variables providing valuable information about the script's location, filename, and more.

Let's take a closer look at the following code snippet that showcases the power of these magic variables:

```bash
__dir="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
__file="${__dir}/$(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"
__file_name="$(basename "$__file")"
__base="$(basename "${__file}" .sh)"
```

In this example, we have a set of variables that provide essential information:

* **__dir**: This variable stores the absolute path of the directory where the script is located. 
* **__file**: Here, we store the absolute path of the script file itself. 
* **__file_name**: This variable holds the name of the script file, excluding the directory path. It's like a name tag that identifies the script in a crowded room.
* **__base**: This variable stores the base name of the script file, without the file extension.

These magic variables enhance the script's flexibility and portability. You can use them to reference files, access resources, or dynamically generate paths based on the script's location. They truly are the script's little helpers, making your coding journey a breeze.

## Main Function - The Heart of the Script

Now, let's explore the pulsating core of our script - the main function. This is where the magic truly happens, as all the script's logic converges in one centralized command station. 

Let's dive into an example that showcases the significance of the main function:

```bash
# Main function
main() {
  # Your script logic here
}
```

In this example, the main function acts as a powerhouse where you can unleash your script's full potential. It's the perfect place to define your script's core functionality, execute key operations, and orchestrate the flow of your script.

Inside the main function, you can bring together various functions, commands, and variables to accomplish the script's goals.

By encapsulating your script's logic within the main function, you achieve several benefits. Firstly, it enhances code readability by providing a clear entry point for understanding the script's purpose. Secondly, it promotes modularity and reusability, as you can call the main function from other parts of your script or even from external scripts.

## Display How to Use the Script - Guiding the Users

Every script needs a user-friendly guide, and this template delivers! The usage() function provides clear instructions on how to use the script, along with a list of available options. Let's see an example:

```bash
# Display how to use the script
usage() {
  cat <<EOF
Usage: $(basename "$__file_name") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]
Script description here.
Available options:
-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info
-f, --flag      Some flag description
-u, --uri       Some param description
-t, --tag       Some param description
EOF
  exit
}
```

## Executed When the Script is Finished - Tidying Up

Just like a responsible host at the end of a party, our script knows how to clean up after itself. The cleanup() function ensures that everything is tidied up when the script finishes its execution. 

Let's take a closer look at the following code snippet that demonstrates the cleanup() function:

```bash
# Executed when the script is finished
cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # Script cleanup here
}
```

In this example, the cleanup() function is called upon the script's completion. It gracefully handles any interrupts, termination signals, or errors that might occur during the script's execution.

Within the cleanup() function, you have the opportunity to perform necessary actions like releasing resources, closing connections, deleting temporary files, or any other cleanup tasks specific to your script. It ensures that your script leaves no loose ends and maintains a tidy environment for future executions.

By employing the trap command to handle signals like SIGINT, SIGTERM, ERR, and EXIT, the cleanup() function acts as a safety net, catching any unexpected events and allowing you to gracefully exit the script.

Remember, proper cleanup not only promotes code hygiene but also contributes to the overall stability and reliability of your script. 

## Helper Functions - Adding Colors and Time Stamps to Your Logs

In addition to the core functionality of the script, the author has included some clever helper functions that enhance the script's logging capabilities. These functions bring a splash of color to your console and provide valuable time-related information. 

### Logging with Colorful Personality

The script doesn't stop at just setting up log colors; it also provides convenient functions to log messages in different colors, adding a touch of personality and emphasis to your logs. Let's dive into some examples of how you can leverage these functions to create eye-catching log messages:

1. Logging with Colors:

To log messages in different colors, you can make use of the msg() function along with the color variables defined in the setup_colors() function. Here's an example of how you can log messages with different colors:

```bash
msg "${RED}This is an error message.${NOFORMAT}"
msg "${GREEN}This is a success message.${NOFORMAT}"
msg "${BLUE}This is an informational message.${NOFORMAT}"
msg "${YELLOW}This is a warning message.${NOFORMAT}"
```

In this example, the log messages are wrapped with the color variables like ${RED}, ${GREEN}, ${BLUE}, and ${YELLOW} to specify the desired color for each message. The ${NOFORMAT} variable is used to reset the color back to the default.

By using colors in your log messages, you can easily differentiate between different types of messages and draw attention to important information.

2. Adding Colors to Informational Messages:

Let's say you want to display some additional information in your logs using colors. Here's an example:

```bash
info "${BLUE}Processing file: ${YELLOW}file.txt${NOFORMAT}"
```

In this example, the info() function is used to log an informational message. The file name, file.txt, is displayed in yellow, while the rest of the message is in blue. This helps to highlight specific details and make them stand out.

3. Logging Errors with Impact:

When an error occurs, you can use the error() function to log the error message in red, indicating its importance. Here's an example:

```bash
error "${RED}An error occurred while executing the command.${NOFORMAT}"
```

This way, when an error arises, it immediately catches your attention with its bold and striking appearance.

4. Capturing Attention with Warnings:

If there's a warning or cautionary message you want to convey, you can use the log() function to log it in orange. Here's an example:

```bash
log "${ORANGE}Warning: The resource limit has been exceeded.${NOFORMAT}"
```

By using colors strategically, you can effectively convey the severity or nature of each log message, making it easier for users to spot and interpret the information.

Remember, these colorful log messages not only provide visual appeal but also enhance the readability and impact of your logs. Choose the appropriate colors based on the context and the type of message you want to convey.

### Date & Time - Capturing the Essence of Every Moment

To add another layer of helpfulness, the script includes two functions, now() and today(), that provide different aspects of date and time information. These functions can be used to generate time stamps, track the script's execution duration, or log time-related events. 

Let's take a look at the code snippets for these time-related functions:

```bash
now() {
  date +%F-%T
}

today() {
  date -I
}
```

In the first example, the now() function returns the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS". It captures the precise moment when a log message or event occurs, giving your script a sense of temporal context.

The second example, the today() function, provides the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". It's useful for tracking daily events or organizing logs based on specific dates.
